# Wand
Wand is an timesheet entry tool which is a tedious task to fill bcoz of its UI functionality.
So coming up with automating the whole process of filling timesheets on weekly basis.
This framework is a data driven where user needs to enter the required parameters like credentials, timesheet date range, hours, leaves/holidays, etc... in 'TimeSheetData.xlsx' sheet.

Notes:
1. Mozilla Firefox must be installed/updated to latest version.
2. Make sure the data in the excel file is accurate.
